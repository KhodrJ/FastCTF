# FastCTF
Fast and robust solver for conduction transfer coefficients / response factors.

Algorithm is described in the pre-print _FastCTF: A Robust Solver for Conduction Transfer Function Coefficients and Thermal Response Factors_ (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16312), submitted to the journal _Energy and Buildings_ for review. If you use this code, please cite this work. I would greatly appreciate it!
