# FastCTF
A fast and robust solver for conduction transfer coefficients / response factors. The program is in standalone form temporarily, I plan to release a version that can be called as a function from other programs.

The algorithm is described in the article _FastCTF: A Robust Solver for Conduction Transfer Function Coefficients and Thermal Response Factors_ (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778821007453) published in the journal _Energy and Buildings_. If you use this code, please cite this work. I would greatly appreciate it!
